Creating a New Git Repository

We started by creating a new Git repository in Visual Studio. This is particularly useful if you have existing code that's not yet associated with Git. Here's what we did:

Selected Git > Create Git Repository from the menu bar.
In the Create a Git Repository dialog box, we entered the necessary information to initialize the repository.
By default, the new repository is private, so we made it PIBLIC.
