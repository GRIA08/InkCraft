Creating a New Git Repository

We started by creating a new Git repository in Visual Studio. This is particularly useful if you have existing code that's not yet associated with Git. Here's what we did:

Selected Git > Create Git Repository from the menu bar.
In the Create a Git Repository dialog box, we entered the necessary information to initialize the repository.
By default, the new repository is private, so we had the option to make it public.

Cloning an Existing Git Repository

Next, we moved on to cloning an existing Git repository. 

We accessed the Clone a Git Repository dialog box.
Pasted the URL of the repository we wanted to clone into the Repository location section.
Selected the desired disk location for the cloned repository.
